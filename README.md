- 🗺️ A user-friendly platform for reporting road damage with geotagged images
- 🧠 AI-powered pothole detection and severity analysis using OpenCV
- 📊 A real-time dashboard for municipal authorities to manage complaints and resolutions
- 📬 Transparent status updates for complainants

> *FixMyStreet is not just a reporting tool — it’s a step toward smarter, safer, and more accountable cities.*
